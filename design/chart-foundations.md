# Chart foundations

> **Status:** skeleton (2026-05-21). Captures the doctrine that the
> upcoming Priority B chart components — `TuxChartLine`, `TuxChartBar`,
> `TuxChartArea`, `TuxChartScatter` — will follow. Fills in with worked
> examples as each component ships.

Reading this before building any chart component is the point. The
patterns here are absorbed from the 2026-05 Figma sweep (Charts UI
Kit, Data Visualization Graphs / Charts Kit, Snow Dashboard) and from
TUX's existing `TuxSparkline` / `TuxChartGeographic` / `TuxChartSunburst`
shipping experience.

## 1. Palette — `--chart-1` through `--chart-8`

Eight categorical hues, maroon-anchored, defined in
[`app/assets/css/tokens.css`](../app/assets/css/tokens.css) and re-
remapped per theme (light / dark / high-contrast):

| Token | Light (default) | Hue family |
|---|---|---|
| `--chart-1` | `var(--brand-primary)` (#5C0025 maroon) | brand anchor |
| `--chart-2` | #3F5A6F | slate teal |
| `--chart-3` | #C7973C | wheat |
| `--chart-4` | #6B8E5A | sage |
| `--chart-5` | #8C5A3C | clay |
| `--chart-6` | #5C7080 | fog |
| `--chart-7` | #A33A3A | rust red |
| `--chart-8` | #3C5A87 | deep blue |

**Rules:**
- **Always start at `--chart-1`** for the primary series. The brand
  anchor leads.
- **Don't reuse `--chart-1` for a secondary "previous-period" overlay
  on the same chart.** Overlays use a muted variant (see §5).
- **Don't expand beyond 8 series.** If a chart needs 9+, the data
  belongs in a table, a small-multiples grid (`TuxVizGrid`), or a
  sunburst (`TuxChartSunburst`) — not a single overcrowded chart.
- **Color is not the only encoder.** Always pair color with one of:
  shape (markers), thickness (stroke), or text (end-of-line label).
  See §3 + §6.

The 8-hue × 3-theme matrix was reaffirmed twice in the medium-signal
pass (Charts UI Kit + Data Viz Graphs both converge on this shape).
Don't re-tune.

## 2. Axis, grid, and legend tokens

_TODO: enumerate as `TuxChartBar` / `TuxChartLine` ship._

Expected anchors:
- `--chart-axis` — axis-line color (likely `--surface-border`)
- `--chart-gridline` — horizontal gridline (likely
  `color-mix(in srgb, var(--surface-border) 50%, transparent)`)
- `--chart-label` — axis tick text (likely `--text-muted`)
- `--chart-legend` — legend text (likely `--text-secondary`)

Tabular numerals (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`) on axis ticks
and value labels everywhere; aligns with the rest of TUX's data
density.

## 3. Value-label placement — in-bar vs above

Absorbed from the Data Viz Graphs kit, which documents the choice as
two distinct text styles ("Percent In-bar" / "Percent Out-bar"):

| Placement | When | Style |
|---|---|---|
| **In-bar** | Bar pixel-height ≥ 24px. Label fits inside the bar without truncation. | White on the bar fill (contrast-checked at AA against the darkest chart hue). Tabular-nums. |
| **Above** | Bar pixel-height < 24px, OR consumer wants prose-rhythm alignment. | `--text-primary` on `--surface-page`. Anchored to the bar top with 4px gap. |
| **Auto (recommended default)** | Let the component pick at render time using the 24px rule. | `valuePlacement="auto"` on the future `TuxChartBar`. |

The 24px threshold is the inflection point where in-bar labels start
to feel cramped — verified visually against the kit's reference frames.

## 4. End-of-line labels on line charts

Absorbed from Data Viz Graphs. **The default behavior** for
`TuxChartLine`, not opt-in:

- For each series, render the final value at the right end of the
  line, colored to match the series stroke.
- Below a width threshold (~480px container), hide the labels and
  fall back to the legend.
- Screen-reader summary should always include the final values
  regardless of label visibility.

This is **a real accessibility win** — color-blind users get series
identity from both color AND adjacent text, no legend round-trip
needed. The pattern transfers cleanly from the kit's dark-canvas
treatment to TUX's white paper-grain default.

## 5. Comparison series (current vs previous)

Absorbed from Snow Dashboard. The pattern: render the previous-period
series as a muted/dashed companion to the primary line or bar.

**For `TuxChartLine`:**
- `series.previous` data array of the same length as the primary
  series (or `null` if not provided).
- Render: same hue family, 60% opacity, dashed stroke (`4 4`).
- Tooltip shows current + previous + delta when both are present.

**For `TuxChartBar`:**
- `series.comparison` data array per category.
- Render: same hue family, 40% opacity, drawn behind the primary bar
  with 4px wider footprint, no fill border — the primary bar sits in
  front like a darker silhouette.
- Use case: "projection vs actual," "target vs realized."

**Anti-pattern:** don't use a *different* hue for the previous-period
series. Same hue, muted — that's the visual cue that says "this is
the same metric, prior window." A different hue reads as a different
metric.

## 6. Brush / range selector on time-series

Absorbed from Charts UI Kit. When a time-series spans a long window
and the user needs to scrub:

- A secondary, dimmed strip of the full series renders below the
  primary chart.
- Two draggable handles bracket the active window; the primary
  chart re-renders to the brushed range.
- The strip is ~64px tall; the brushed window is highlighted with
  `color-mix(in srgb, var(--brand-primary) 6%, transparent)`.

Shipped via either a `withBrush` boolean prop on `TuxChartLine` or a
named slot (`#range`) so consumers can drop a custom strip. Final
choice deferred to build time.

## 7. KPI strip composition

Absorbed from Snow Dashboard + Charts UI Kit. When a chart anchors a
section, the parent template composes a KPI strip above:

```vue
<section>
  <TuxFactoid
    density="3"
    :items="[
      { value: 89_529, label: 'Total · this week' },
      { value: 83_529, suffix: ' (-7%)', label: 'Previous week' },
      { value: 5_000,  label: 'Δ delta' },
    ]"
  />
  <TuxChartArea :series="series" stacked />
</section>
```

**The KPIs and the chart are siblings**, not nested inside a
single component. The chart doesn't bake KPI math; the parent reads
the data once, exposes summary stats, and hands the chart the same
data. This keeps `TuxChartArea` honest about its job (renders shapes)
and lets the consumer swap KPI affordances (BigStat / Factoid /
single-stat) without forking the chart.

## 8. Accessibility — alt-text + screen-reader summaries

`TuxSparkline` already ships the pattern; future chart components
follow:

- **SR-only summary** derived from the data: "Trend: 12 points,
  low 18.2, high 24.7, last 23.1 (up 4.9 from first)."
- **`<title>` inside the SVG** for hover/SR readouts.
- **`aria-labelledby` + `aria-describedby`** wiring when the chart
  ships an external caption (e.g. inside `TuxChartFrame`).
- **No relying on color alone** — see §1 rule "Color is not the only
  encoder."

For chart kinds where the SR summary is non-obvious (sunburst, geo
choropleth), components ship an `ariaSummary` prop the consumer can
override with a curated sentence.

## 9. Editorial framing — `TuxChartFrame`

When a chart appears in a report or paper context, wrap it in
`TuxChartFrame` to inherit the editorial chrome:

- Uppercase tracked eyebrow ("Exhibit 11.04")
- Display-face title (Oswald)
- 2px maroon signature rule
- Chart body (the slotted chart component)
- Footnote + source citation lines

In dashboard tiles, drop the frame — the surrounding TuxCard
provides equivalent chrome.

## Status by component

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| `TuxSparkline` | Shipped — inline mini-trend; native SVG; SR summary; tone-aware |
| `TuxChartGeographic` | Shipped — Texas-flavored maps; 5 kinds (county / districts / states / dot / OD) |
| `TuxChartSunburst` | Shipped — two-ring radial |
| `TuxChartFrame` | Shipped — editorial wrapper |
| `TuxChartLine` | Roadmap Priority B — see §4, §5, §6 |
| `TuxChartBar` | Roadmap Priority B — see §3, §5 |
| `TuxChartArea` | Roadmap Priority B — see §7 |
| `TuxChartScatter` | Roadmap Priority B |

Build order is roughly Line → Bar → Area → Scatter, but consumer
pressure (Landscape dashboard data shape) may re-order.

## How this doc evolves

When a `TuxChart*` component ships, expand its §section above with
the worked code example and the actual prop shape. The skeleton's
job is to set doctrine; ship-time fills the body.
